Repository is a foundation for measurements that I presented in the talk with the same title. I have performed it on following conferences:

Scenarios:

- *Cold Start* effect.
- *Latency* distribution.
- *Memory* usage test.

Languages:

- Haskell (*AWS Lambda* via *Node.js* shim)
- F# (*AWS Lambda*, officially support by *Serverless Framework*)
- Scala (*AWS Lambda*, officially support by *Serverless Framework*)
- Clojure (*AWS Lambda* on *JVM*)
- ClojureScript (*AWS Lambda* on *Node.js*)
- BuckleScript (*AWS Lambda* on *Node.js*)
